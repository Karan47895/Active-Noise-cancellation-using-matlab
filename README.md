Active noise cancellation (ANC) is a transformative technology that effectively reduces or eliminates unwanted ambient sounds by generating anti-noise signals that destructively interfere with the original noise. By capturing ambient noise with a microphone and generating anti-noise signals with opposite phases, ANC systems cancel out unwanted sounds, creating a quieter and more comfortable environment. Widely utilized in aviation, automotive, consumer electronics, and industrial settings, ANC enhances passenger comfort in aircraft cabins, mitigates road and engine noise in vehicles, and provides users with clearer audio experiences in headphones and earbuds. Overall, ANC technology offers a versatile solution for combating noise pollution and improving audio quality across various applications and industries.
